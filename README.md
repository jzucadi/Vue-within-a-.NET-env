# Toucan

This is an opinionated multi-project solution template, combining .Net Core and Vuejs.

The main objective is to provide scaffolding for an SPA web application, that incorporates SOLID design principles.

## Features
* localization
* validation
* global application state/event bus
* multiple optimized entry points
* token-based authentication
* support for local or external authentication providers

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [.NET Core SDK 1.0.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/#windowscmd)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/) (or a similar text-based editor like Sublime)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### Installing

#### Project Dependencies
Update and build the .NET Core projects by switching to to ./src/server and running

```DOS
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

Update and build the TypeScript UI project by switching to ./src/ui and running

```DOS
npm install
npm install webpack -g
npm install typings -g
typings install
webpack -p --config webpack/development.js
```
#### Configuration

The first step in configuration is to decide what backing database to use, and then invoke scaffolding tools to generate initial data migrations.

##### For PostgreSQL

* update *<data:connectionString>* configuration key inside *./src/server/app.development.json*
* update `ConfigureServices()` method in *./src/server/startup.cs*, and uncomment the code block starting `services.AddDbContext<NpgSqlContext>`
* add the same connection string details to *./src/data/npgsql.json* (required for EF tooling)
* scaffold migrations by switching to *./src/data* and running
```DOS
dotnet ef --startup-project ../server migrations add Initial -c NpgSqlContext
```

##### For SQL Server

* update <data:connectionString>* configuration key inside *./src/server/app.development.json*
* update the `ConfigureServices()` method in *./src/server/startup.cs*, and uncomment the code block starting `services.AddDbContext<MsSqlContext>`
* add the same connection string details to *./src/data/mssql.json* (required for EF tooling)
* create migrations by switching to *./src/data* and running
```DOS
dotnet ef --startup-project ../server migrations add Initial -c MsSqlContext
```

##### External Authentication

The system by default enables users to create a local login account using a signup page, which stores their credentials in the database.

It also enables users to login via an external authentication provider, using the [OAuth 2.0 Implicit](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2) grant workflow.

The project currently provides support for

- [X] [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent)
- [X] [Microsoft](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh243647.aspx)

To configure the

* Google Provider - edit `const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` key in *google-provider.ts* file, and `clientId` in *app.development.json*
* Microsoft Provider - edit `const MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` key in *microsoft-provider.ts* file, and `clientId` in *app.development.json*

To remove a provider from appearing the UI, edit `externalProviders` class property in *login.ts*

##### Startup
Run the project by switching to ./src/server and running

```DOS
dotnet run -p server.csproj -c Development
```
You should now be able to load the site at [https://localhost:5000/](https://localhost:5000/)

## Overview

### Authentication
[JWT Bearer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523) tokens are issued by the server. These tokens contain profile data and claims relating to a user. Authentication can be done in two different ways.

#### via Local Provider
This requires a user to create an account using the signup form. In this scenario, the server

* enforces a minimum password complexity rule when signing up
* generates a salt, and stores hashed password to the database
* retreives and maps user profile data and permissions when generating client tokens

#### via External Providers
This is performed using a variation on the [implicit workflow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2). The sequence of events is as follows. 

* browser obtains a one-use nonce from local server (which must be redeemed/used before it expires)
* the browser is redirected to external provider, and authenticated
* external provider issues a redirect, and returns the nonce and access token details via uri (ie. _http://localhost:5142/#state=XYZ&access_token=4/P7q7W91&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600_)
* the vuejs application is bootstrapped, and checks the uri hash for nonce and access_token
* if present, these are passed to the local server
* the local server validates the nonce and access token, and if satisfied, issues the client with a local token (the external access token is also revoked)

If this is the first time a user has logged in using this external provider, a user account will be created for them based on data from external profile data APIs.

### Verification

Before a site user can access restricted content they need to verify their account details using some form of two-factor authentication. They are redirected to the verification page when appropriate.

The default implementation is as follows

* user asks site to issue a verification code
* server returns verification code
* client browser outputs the verification code using `console.info()` and displays form on page
* the verification code is submitted, and a new access token (with updated details) is issued by the server

### Authorization
Server-side routes are protected via [policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies) which provide more flexibility than traditional role-based models.

Client-side routes are protected via [navigation guards](http://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/navigation-guards.html), which check user claims contained in access tokens issued by the server.

> If an authorization check on the web server fails, a challenge is issued to the client browser. Normally this results in a 302 redirect, but this behaviour has been modified using custom middleware in *./src/server/Startup.Auth.cs*. This middleware instead returns a 200 OK response whilst setting Response header _Location=XXX_. The client-side Axios library then handles this appropriately, by way of a global http response interceptor.

### Security

TLS is provided by using a self-signed X509 certificate (see _./src/server/resources_ )

Support for [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) has been provided.

> The site sets CSRF session cookies whenever an access token is issued

The Axios library automatically uses this cookie to append the anti-forgery token to outbound POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
